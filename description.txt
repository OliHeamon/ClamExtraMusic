A port of the 1.3 mod "Calamity Mod Extra Music", with permission from ENNWAY (aka Turquoise, composer of all the music).

This mod aims to add themes for vanilla features that don't already have unique themes. Most, if not all bosses will sometime recieve their own themes exclusive to this mod!

Boss themes:
-King Slime
-Eye of Cthulhu
-Eater of Worlds
-Brain of Cthulhu
-Queen Bee
-Wall of Flesh
-Destroyer/Twins/Skeletron Prime
-Duke Fishron
-Lunatic Cultist

Event themes:
-Blizzard

Biome themes:
-Meteor

Notes: 
Music boxes may be added in a future patch.

Blood Nautilus uses the same theme as the Wall of Flesh, while Deerclops uses the same theme as the Eye of Cthulhu.

Queen Slime and Empress of Light do not have custom themes, as their vanilla variants are already unique.
