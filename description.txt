A port of the 1.3 mod "Calamity Mod Extra Music", with permission from ENNWAY (aka Turquoise, composer of all the music). Now on 1.4.4!

This mod aims to add themes for vanilla features that don't already have unique themes. This mod is client-side, so you do not have to install it on the server for it to work.

Boss themes:
-King Slime
-Eye of Cthulhu
-Eater of Worlds
-Brain of Cthulhu
-Queen Bee
-Skeletron
-Wall of Flesh
-Destroyer/Twins/Skeletron Prime
-Plantera
-Golem
-Duke Fishron
-Lunatic Cultist
-Moon Lord

Event themes:
-Blizzard

Biome themes:
-Meteor

Notes: 
Music boxes may be added in a future patch.

Each theme can be individually toggled on and off in the config.
